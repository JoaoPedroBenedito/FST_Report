In this report it's described the solution used to power supply the low power consumption circuit, in order to avoid the use of an extra battery, reduce the weight and reduce the conection complexity. In Figure \ref{fig:low_power_supply} is shown how will be implemented the new power supply system without the use of an extra battery.\par

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:low_power_supply}, this system is connected in parallel to the battery. In Figure \ref{fig:low_power_schematic} is represented the schematic of the Low power system power supply.
